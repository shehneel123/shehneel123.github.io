Collaboratively created a website to serve as an educational resource for refugees in Jordan. The website hosts information about basic health tips for both parents and children, an introduction to writing/reading English, as well as mathematical operations and science topics. Translated the English text to Arabic, as well as used an API in which if the user clicks a button, all of the text will be read out to them in Arabic. This project was completed for a Girls Who Summer Immersion Program final project and was presented in front of JP Morgan Chase employees and other professionals.
