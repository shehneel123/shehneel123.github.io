  <p>Every year, volunteers join with<br> an organization called Rahbar Trust<br> to visit and help refugees in Jordan. Below show some of the<br> memorable moments that they spent<br> with the families. Our purpose for creating this<br> website was to educate the refugees, along<br> with help them build a better life<br> for themselves. </p>

  <h4><p>This is a photo of the children in the camps at Jordan. The chidren were of all ages. Many of them were orphans or didn't have any sibilings. However, the women treated all of the kids as their own children.</p></h4>

  <h5><p>When the volunteers visited Jordan this summer, they joined the children in a game of soccer. It was heartwarming to see their faces light up from the game. It seemed to be a moment where they really felt like children. We hope to provide them with more moments of happiness like this.</p></h5>
